# Document-Clustering
This assignment is for the task of clustering in Information Retrieval using k-means algorithm .The dataset we have selected a subset of dataset of NewsGroup20. There are
50 documents from 5 different classes.Feature selection for clustering is achieved using 3 baseline techinques :

Baseline – I - A baseline for the clustering by using all TF based features
using any filtering criteria like TF scores for the selected term (feature).

Baseline – II – A slightly string baseline using TF*IDF feature selection using all
TF based features using any filtering criteria like TF scores for the selected term (feature) and DF
filtering criteria based on DF.

Word2Vec embedding of selected TF can be used as a semantic feature to perform clustering . The final result is evaluated using clustering
